## What is Magic the Gathering? 

<p> [Magic the Gathering (MTG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is the most played collectable card around the world in many languages which was first released in 1993. MTG currently has printed over 20,000 unique cards with hundreds more printed every year in different expansion sets and a main yearly set. MTG has many different formats of play which impact cards allowed in the game, number of cards in a deck, how many players in a game, etc, similerly to the differences between different dice games. <p>  

<p> The goal of this project is a create random Magic the Gathering deck based on user entered parameters. Using user-defeined functions written in PostgreSQL 12; entered parameters are used to query the relational database that contains all current MTG cards and the cards' properties that are split into 8 tables. The data is sourced from [MTG JSON](https://mtgjson.com/) which describes itself as "open-source project that catalogs all Magic: The Gathering cards in a portable format." <p>
